\title{Monthly Fama French 6 Factor Returns}
\format{An \code{xts} object with 690 observations and 7 columns. 
The data run from July, 1963 through December, 2020.
As in the upstream source, the data are given in \emph{percents}, meaning a
value of 1.00 corresponds to a 1\% movement.
Note also that returns presumably are \sQuote{simple} returns, not log
returns, though this is not clarified by the upstream source.
The columns are defined as follows:
\describe{
 \item{\code{Mkt}}{The Market monthly return. Note that the risk free rate has been added back to the excess returns published by the upstream source.}
 \item{\code{SMB}}{The cap factor monthly return.}
 \item{\code{HML}}{The growth factor monthly return.}
 \item{\code{UMD}}{The momentum factor monthly return.}
 \item{\code{RMW}}{The profitability factor monthly return.}
 \item{\code{CMA}}{The investment factor monthly return.}
 \item{\code{RF}}{The risk-free rate, presumably as a monthly rate. The average value is arround 0.39, corresponding to an annualized rate of around 4.7\%.}
