\title{Monthly Fama French 5 Industry Returns}
\format{An \code{xts} object with 1,104 observations and 5 columns. 
The data run from January, 1927 through December, 2018.
As in the upstream source, the data are given in \emph{percents}, meaning a
value of 1.00 corresponds to a 1\% movement.
Note also that returns presumably are \sQuote{simple} returns, not log
returns, though this is not clarified by the upstream source.
The columns are defined as follows:
\describe{
 \item{\code{Consumer}}{The monthly returns of the Consumer industry, published as \dQuote{Cnsmr}.}
 \item{\code{Manufacturing}}{The monthly returns of the Manufacturing industry, published as \dQuote{Manuf}.}
 \item{\code{Technology}}{The monthly returns of the Technology industry, published as \dQuote{HiTec}.}
 \item{\code{Healthcare}}{The monthly returns of the Healthcare industry, published as \dQuote{Hlth}.}
 \item{\code{Other}}{The monthly returns of the Other industry, published as \dQuote{Other}.}
